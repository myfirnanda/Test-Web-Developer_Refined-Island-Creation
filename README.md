# Web Developer Test – Refined Island Creation

This project is a clean and responsive implementation of several interactive web features, built with **HTML**, **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**, and **JavaScript**.  
Key features include:
- **Sticky Header** – smoothly appears and disappears based on scroll direction  
- **Scroll-to-Top Button** – quickly returns the page to the top with a single click  
- **Dark Mode Toggle** – theme switching with persistent user preference  
- **Image Modal Viewer** – enlarges an image in a modal when clicked  

The entire website is **100% responsive**, following a **mobile-first** design approach with Tailwind CSS.  
Extra attention was given to **pixel-perfect implementation**, matching the intended design as closely as possible by carefully selecting similar fonts and images.
